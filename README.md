# Getting Captain working with Cucumber

Starting from a [simple workflow that runs cucumber][workflow-before-captain], we want to

1. üß™ Ensure cucumber produces json output

`cucumber --format json --out tmp/cucumber.json` will produce captain-compatible json output in `tmp/cucumber.json`.
For github logs to continue to have test output, also include a stdout-friendly formatter (`--format progess` for dots
`--format pretty` for full test names)

```sh
bundle exec cucumber \
  --format json --out tmp/cucumber.json \
  --format pretty
```

2. üîê Create an Access Token

Create an Access Token for your organization within [Captain][captain] ([more documentation here][create-access-token]).

Add the new token as an action secret to your repository. Conventionally, we call this secret `RWX_ACCESS_TOKEN`.

3. üíå Install the Captain CLI, and then call it when running tests

See the [full documentation on test suite integration][test-suite-integration].

```yaml
- uses: rwx-research/setup-captain@v1
- run: |
    captain run \
      --suite-id captain-examples-cucumber \
      --test-results tmp/cucumber.json \
      -- \
      bundle exec cucumber \
        --format json --out tmp/cucumber.json \
        --format pretty
  env:
    RWX_ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.RWX_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
```

4. üéâ See your test results in Captain!
